  desc: "The iPhone was first introduced in June 2007. It was groundbreaking, however the camera was lacking. In 2011, the iPhone 4s was released, changing the mobile photography game forever with its 8MP camera. This let the iOS App Store thrive with an abundance of photo and video editing apps, more so than any other app store (still). Currently, the iPhone Xs line of cameras have 12MP, two lenses, one telephoto and one wide; it can also record slow-motion video up to 120 fps and 4K video up to 60 fps."
